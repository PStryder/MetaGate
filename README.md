# MetaGate
MetaGate is a bootstrap authority and configuration witness for LegiVellum-compatible systems.  It authenticates callers, resolves identity and bindings, returns a complete description of the world a component is entering, issues a startup receipt as a witness—and then gets out of the way. Who are you, what are you, and what world are you in?
